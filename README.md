# Pattern Matcher Using STM32 NUCLEO Microcontroller
This project requires the use of the STM32 NUCLEO board, where the black reset button (GPIOA_PIN_15) and the blue start button (GPIPA_PIN_13) will be required to start the game and the levels respectively. Software requires to first be uploaded to the central STM board, and circuits for 6 separate led systems need to be utilized for generating led output. In addition, for input reception to the software system, a keypad needs to be connected (preferably the 4X4 "123A456B789C*0#D" version) to pins 7,8,9, and 10 for GPIO PORT A. Utilizing this hardware and having at least one USB-A port to connect the whole board to a system will allow the user to access the ultimate pattern matcher lock prototype.
